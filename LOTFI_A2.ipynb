Next, we want to find all earlier notes by that same author. In the NOTEEVENTS table, we want to filter and find all rows with the same CG_ID and a CHARTDATE earlier than your note's chartdate. Next, we want to find out if any of those patients had diabetes before the notes were written about them. To do so, we can collect the distinct HADM_ID (hospital admission IDs) of those earlier notes and check for pre-existing diabetes diagnoses in those admissions. Join each of those HADM_IDs to Diagnoses_ICD on HADM_ID. Then, filter Diagnoses_ICD for only '250' which corresponds with a diabetes diagnosis. To be sure the diagnosis pre-dated the note, another possibility is to join ADMISSIONS on HADM_ID and require ADMISSIONS.ADMITTIME < your note's chartname. After these steps, if the query returns any rows, this means that the answer is yes, the doctor who wrote that note has previously written a note about a patient with a pre-existing ICD9 diagnosis for diabetes.

For instance, since there is a stigma around smoking in the US as a result of its clear negative health effects, even if a patient is a smoker, they may not admit that to their doctor, resulting in a case of under-reporting of smoking. Conversely, teens or younger adults may report that they smoke to seem 'cool' which would result in a case of over-reporting. I believe that it is more likely that smoking is under-reported than over-reported. This is because there is such a stigma around smoking in the US, as well as across different cultural and religious groups, which would motivate many different demographic groups to not report their smoking. \n",

Also, pregnant women would be a patient population in the under-reporting category as they would most likely be afraid to disclose to their doctors that they are smoking during their pregnancy (clear negative side effects for child). In contrast, as mentioned above, young adults and children would be a patient population that might have more over-reporting than others to look 'cool'. Also, if someone who was previously a smoker and marked as such in the database then quit, this would be a case of over-reporting as well.  </span>"

This is because as a result of greater educational programming about the harmful effects of smoking, smoking rates have decreased over time so individuals born closer to 2010 are less likely to smoke than those born closer to 1980. The reasons described above suggest that the true correlation is most likely weaker than what is calculated, as there are cases of over-reporting of young adults and under-reporting of older adults as well.  </span>"

    "> Sometimes a data element of interest does not appear in the data you have access to. A possible work-around is to use a proxy data element known to be correlated with the data element of interest. For example, [Frankovich et al.](http://www.snubi.org/~juhan/Futurefile/Evidence-Based%20Medicine%20in%20the%20EMR%20Era.pdf) used aspirin records as a proxy for antiphospholipid antibody labs.\n",

    "<span style=\"color:blue;\"> First, you can look for clinical measurements or medications (labs, prescriptions, diagnosis, etc) that are associated, or occur in parallel, with the variable of interest. For example, metforin and insulin prescriptions can be used for a proxy that a patient has type 2 diabetes. In a similar manner, vitals or lab measurements can be used as a proxy for a variable of interest: namely, HbA1c / glucose levels to assess for diabetic patients. Another approach would be to analyze ICD or CPT codes for diseases or procedures that are associated with the data element of interest. You can also assess correlation via expert chart review. It is important to have an expert clinician involved in the study to design and identify new proxxies (having an expert in the loop). In addition, you can also use alternative data sources that have the variable of interest and then find the correlates from there.  </span>"
